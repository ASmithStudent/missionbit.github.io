            <p>
                Mission Bit is a non-profit that offers free programming classes taught by
                <a href="about-us/#lead-instructors">experienced engineers and entrepreneurs</a>
                to San Francisco public school students. We provide everything
                the students need, they just need to show up and be eager to learn. No prior experience
                required.
            </p>
            <p>
                We give students the opportunity to learn directly from successful engineers and
                entrepreneurs who enjoy sharing knowledge and want to give back
                to the community. We're focused on project based learning and aim to teach both
                core computer science concepts as well as the practical skills and technologies that are
                required to build web sites and applications today.

            <ul>
                <li>50% of San Francisco's public high schools do not offer any kind of computer science class.</li>
                <li>Local businesses scour the globe for top talent, we want to provide more opportunities to our community.</li>
                <li>Many skilled programmers would love to teach, but need an organization like Mission Bit to make it feasible.</li>

The new effort by Mission Bit and HackReactor may be a first step towards plugging the leak. If the program is successful, subsequent iterations may establish the first stable pathway to technology sector jobs for San Francisco students." <a href="http://www.sfbg.com/2014/06/17/disrupting-classroom" target="_blank"> read more </a> </p>
