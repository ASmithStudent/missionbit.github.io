        Join us for a day of hacking! At Mission Bit, weâ€™re working to close the tech divide through a three-part strategy of exposing, engaging and employing young people to pursue college degrees in computer science and careers as software engineers. Through our efforts, we seek to encourage students to become aware of and take part in the growing technology field. This event will include different workshops as well as the creation of a prototype, by each team, of their own custom learning management system.  Each team will be able to pitch and demonstrate their project that will be judged based on the specifications set forth at the beginning of the day.  We believe this hackathon will encourage students to actively participate in designing their future.
