        <p>
            Mission Bit is a non-profit that offers free programming classes taught by
            <a href="about-us/#lead-instructors">experienced engineers and entrepreneurs</a>
            to San Francisco public school students. We provide everything
            the students need, they just need to show up and be eager to learn. No prior experience
            required.
        </p>
        <p>
            We give students the opportunity to learn directly from successful engineers and
            entrepreneurs who enjoy sharing knowledge and want to give back
            to the community. We're focused on project based learning and aim to teach both
            core computer science concepts as well as the practical skills and technologies that are
            required to build web sites and applications today. We partner with the public school system,
            <a href="http://www.outofsite-sf.org/" target="_blank">Out of Site</a>, and
            <a href="http://www.jamestownsf.org/" target="_blank">Jamestown Community Center</a> to
            provide elective credit to students that counts towards their graduation.

                        I grew up in an at-risk low income rural community in upstate New York. Entering high school, I charted a path that helped me bust through the challenges of my environment and led to new exciting opportunities and experiences. I feel really lucky and appreciate the help, direction and understanding I received along the way. All kids benefit from a bit of guidance, attention and energy. This is especially true for youth growing up in challenging situations. Mission Bit is my 'thank you'. Hopefully, it provides some support to kids in SF seeking more for themselves and helps create new opportunities if they are willing to put in the work.
