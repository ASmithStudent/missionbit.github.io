The main character is an orphan and one of the only few humans who can use magic because his/her father infused his own blood with dragon blood, giving his child (you/main character) magical abilities. However humans with magical abilities are considered evil, as many use their magic for their own personal gain (greed, power, etc.) and are called Endonin or Endors for short.
