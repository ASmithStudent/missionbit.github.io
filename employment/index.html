        Mission Bit Career Prep is a free 60 hours immersive course that goes over the basics of javascript. In addition to an introduction to javascript, students will learn more about the tech sector job market and recieve career-education advising that will support students in finding additional learning opportunities that lead to jobs. As an organization, we intend to close the tech divide and create learning opportunities that address the long standing issues of income inequality in the San Francisco Bay Area. This course is designed for graduating 12th graders or recent high school graduate under the age of 24 with little or no coding experience. At the end of the course, students will recieve a stipend of $500 for their successful completion.
      </p>
      <p>
          Course enrollment is limited to 12 students per class and slated to run from June 26, 2017 to July 18, 2017. Class times are Monday through Friday from 9am to 2pm. We are interested in engaging students that are underrepresented in the tech industry: women, African American, Polynesian and Latino students. Students that have completed a Mission Bit Introduction to Web Course will receive priority enrollment in this unique opportunity. Before enrolling please be mindful that 100% attendance is mandatory and critical to your success in the program.
