      <h2>Software Engineer pathways to employment</h2>
      <p>
          In partnership with <a href="http://reactorcore.com/">Hack Reactor Core</a>, Mission Bit offers a free 60 hour immersive coding course called Mission Bit Employs. As an organization, our long term strategy is to put underrepresented students in a position to enroll in college as a computer science major or start a career as a software engineer. This course is designed to build a pathway for High School Seniors with little or no coding experience to puruse postsecondary opportunities focused on software engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
          Course enrollment is limited to 12 students per class and slated to begin Feburary 21, 2017 to March 23, 2017. We are interested in engaging students that are underrepresented in the tech industry: women, African American, Polynesian and Latino students. Students that have completed a Mission Bit course receive priority enrollment in this unique opportunity. Before enrolling please be mindful that 100% attendance is mandatory and critical to your success in the program.
