Within the semester the class will build websites and interactive applications. At the end of the semester, the class is broken up into teams, each paired with an instructor and spends a few weeks building a final project. Projects in prior semesters have included HTML5 games, an interactive light show that change the hue of lights based on sound frequency, a browser-based drawing tool and a basic instant messaging app.
